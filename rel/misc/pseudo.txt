init new array and copy contents of tubuDt into it, expand to 87 elements. 
Replace all references to tubuDt to new array, and add extries to win_log_mapGX_arr.
Update first visit check to account for new nodes.

Alternative: Modify 2 entires in tubuDt to become the new nodes instead, 
while still updating win_log_mapGX_arr and first visit check.
